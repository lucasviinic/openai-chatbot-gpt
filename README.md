## Python e GPT: Creating a chatbot with AI

The project involves creating an AI-powered chatbot using Python and Flask in conjunction with GPT.

**Step 1:** Integrating API with front-end

- Connecting GPT to our chatbot's front-end by creating routes using the Flask microframework;
- Identifying the advantages of using Stream configuration in our chatbot, including real-time responses, continuous interaction, time savings, improved user experience, and the ability to halt response generation before completion, analyzing how we receive messages in our chatbot compared to ChatGPT;
- Configuring our project to accommodate the stream=True configuration for the bot, creating a function to handle the received response, and updating our front-end to display these changes in real-time.
